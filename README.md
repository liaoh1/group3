This teamwork documentation is created for developing a given software, from cloning an existing repositoty of gray-scott-simulator to implementing a testing framework. This also involves collaboraively building system and continuous integration of this code repository.


### Clone Repository
https://github.com/scicomp-durham/gray-scott-sim

### Testing FrameWork
https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/README.md
https://github.com/mity/acutes

Most of us have been familiarized with cmake command, but
we still need to evaluate the best framework of test to approach.



### Create a build system for the software, and





### Implement continuous integration (CI) for your repository.
