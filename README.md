This teamwork documentation is created for developing a given software, from cloning an existing repositoty of gray-scott-simulator to implementing a testing framework. This also involves collaboraively building system and continuous integration of this code repository.


### Clone Repository
https://github.com/scicomp-durham/gray-scott-sim

### Testing FrameWork
https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/README.md
https://github.com/mity/acutes

Most of us have been familiarized with cmake command, but
we still need to evaluate the best framework of test to approach.

#### To Do
(0.1) Check that the type of the model parameters (F , k) matches that of the element type
of the u and v vectors.
(0.2) Check that the variables u and v are the same size. (0.3) Check that the simulation produces the mathematically correct answer when u = 0 and
v = 0.
(0.3) Check that the simulation produces the mathematically correct answer when u = 0 and
v = 0.



### Create a build system for the software 

#### To Do
Clear build instructions in a correct, concise format.



### Implement continuous integration (CI) for your repository.
